# Booking Functionality

The booking feature uses a mock API endpoint (https://66b1f8e71ca8ad33d4f5f63e.mockapi.io/bookings). Ensure that the API structure in campersOperations.js matches the structure required by the mock API.

# Deployment

For deployment, you can use any static site hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Make sure to set up the appropriate environment variables if required by your API.

# API Documentation

The application interacts with a mock API provided by MockAPI for booking functionality and retrieving camper data. Here is a basic overview:

Endpoints
GET /campers: Fetches a list of campers with filtering options (location, amenities).
GET /campers/:id: Fetches details of a specific camper.
POST /bookings: Creates a booking for a camper.
